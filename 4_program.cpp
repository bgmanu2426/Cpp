/*
Write a C++ program to create class called MATRIX using two-dimensional array of integers, by
overloading the operator == which checks the compatibility of two matrices to be added and
subtracted. Perform the addition and subtraction by overloading + and – operators
respectively. Display the results by overloading the operator <<. If (m1 == m2) then m3 = m1 +
m2 and m4 = m1 – m2 else display error
